    "Instructions": "In all tasks, you will hear two words one after the other. Please indicate whether the two words in the pair are related in meaning. If the pair of words matches, please press the button under your index finger. If they do not match, press the button under your middle finger. The button press should be hard, taking the finger off swiftly. Please press the button as soon as you know the answer, as we record both accuracy and reaction time. The word pairs will alternate with sequences of tones. Please indicate whether the sequences of tones are identical (match) or un-identical (nonmatch). There will also be sequences where you will hear nothing and see black fixation crosses. Just press the button with your index finger when the cross turns red. A red fixation cross will appear after each pair of items (words, tones, or black crosses). Please maintain your eyes on the cross.",

    "TaskDescription": "Subjects were presented with two spoken English words and a black fixation cross. Word pairs were categorized according to their free association value. 24 word pairs had high association values (e.g., web-spider), 24 word pairs had lower association values (e.g., guide-tour), and 24 pairs had an association value of zero. Each word was presented for 800 ms separated by a 200 ms interstimulus interval. The second stimulus was followed by a red fixation square lasting 2600 ms indicating the need to make a response. Perceptual control trials were included involving tone matching. The simple perceptual trials included 24 pairs of pure tones, ranging from 325 to 875 Hz. The complex perceptual trials included 24 pairs of three-tone stimuli, where all component tones were within the 325 to 875 Hz range. Subjects were asked to report whether the two presented tones matched or did not. 60 null trials were included to control for motor responses in which a black fixation cross was presented instead of words. The timing for the null and perceptual trials was the same as for the lexical trials. This yielded 180 trials. Trials were randomized and divided into one 91 trial run titled task-SemanticAud_run-01 and one 89 trial run titled task-SemanticAud_run-02.",
